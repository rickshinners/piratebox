# Tips
* all volumes can be removed by running: ```docker-compose down -v```

* external volumes can be created against mount points like this: ```docker volume create --opt type=none --opt device=/path/to/shows --opt o=bind --name series```


# Intitial setup
When the docker volumes are created you'll need to do some initial setup to ensure the nginx reverse proxy works with each subsystem and that they can talk to each other.
